## Project Notes

Maven build configuration updated to use Quarkus 3.27.0 LTS. Native image compilation requires additional reflection configuration for Jackson serialization.

## Technical Insights

Quarkus native builds use GraalVM. Any classes used via reflection need to be registered in reflection-config.json or annotated with @RegisterForReflection.
