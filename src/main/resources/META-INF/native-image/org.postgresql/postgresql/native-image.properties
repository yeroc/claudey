# GraalVM Native Image configuration for PostgreSQL JDBC Driver
#
# This file supplements the metadata from the GraalVM reachability-metadata
# repository (org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.3), which only includes
# reflect-config.json for geometric types.
#
# SSPIClient must be initialized at runtime because it uses Windows-specific
# native libraries via Waffle-JNA for SSPI authentication. Build-time
# initialization fails on non-Windows platforms and when native libraries
# aren't available.

# See: https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/1189
